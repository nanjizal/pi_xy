# rectPack2d
My port of RectPack2D to haxe, making some tweaks with the view to integration within pi_xy.  It could be separate but makes sense to integrate so that pi_xy can be used more easily for sprite sheets and automatic layout.

## my original port.

additional related repos, will need to mix some of them in.
