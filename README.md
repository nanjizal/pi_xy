#### pixelimage, pixel image lib initially aimed at haxe js ( but may extend for c++ haxe target ), can be used easily with htmlHelper
  
```setARGB, getARGB, fillRect, fillTri, fillRegPoly( for circles and ellipses )```
  
since ellipses/circles use triangles there are some non overlap aspects that need consideration, fillRegPoly is still under dev 
  
#### allows easy getting and setting to the canvas 
  
```drawToContext and drawFromContext```
